error during build:
[vite-plugin-pwa:build] [plugin vite-plugin-pwa:build] There was an error during the build:
  [vite]: Rollup failed to resolve import "@babel/runtime/helpers/typeof" from "C:/Users/Jeanc/OneDrive/├ürea de Trabalho/VitrineX-AI - APP/node_modules/jspdf/dist/jspdf.es.min.js".
This is most likely unintended because it can break your application at runtime.
If you do want to externalize this module explicitly add it to
`build.rollupOptions.external`
Additionally, handling the error in the 'buildEnd' hook caused the following error:
  [vite]: Rollup failed to resolve import "@babel/runtime/helpers/typeof" from "C:/Users/Jeanc/OneDrive/├ürea de Trabalho/VitrineX-AI - APP/node_modules/jspdf/dist/jspdf.es.min.js".
